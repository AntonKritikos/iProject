# iProject
Here we made a site for uploading and finding uploaded `snippets` on our website.

In the [index.php](https://github.com/bikerboyasd/iProject/blob/master/index.php)
we made use of the `get` variable in order to determine what view we would like to include.

If you look in the [Views folder](https://github.com/bikerboyasd/iProject/tree/master/view) 
you can see all the views files we have created and use.
